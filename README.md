# mixedsets
Building a series of mixed sets of molecules based on their NMR chemical shifts
Mixedsets use quality threshold clustering algorithm to cluster NMR chemical shifts dataset in order to resolve chemical shift overlap problem when you mix multiple compounds in a single NMR tube in a library screen.
